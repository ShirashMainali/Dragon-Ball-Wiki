            <p>Kaio-ken </br> (界かい王おう拳けん Kaiōken, lit. "World King Fist" or "Fist of the King of the Worlds") is a technique invented by King Kai; however, Goku is the only person ever to use it successfully. It is a technique that multiplies the user's ki for a "heartbeat" - thus increasing their power and speed and enabling them to inflict serious damage to opponents who are considerably stronger than them. However, the downside of the Kaio-ken is that it takes a heavy toll on the user's body, making them more vulnerable to enemy attacks. While in the state, the user's aura color becomes crimson. The technique requires the use of ki control to handle it properly.

            <p>Super Saiyan </br>(超スーパーサイヤ人じん Sūpā Saiya-jin, lit. Super Saiyan Person) is an advanced transformation utilized by members and hybrids of the Saiyan race that have sufficient amounts of S-Cells in the Dragon Ball franchise. Earthlings with Saiyan heritage in Dragon Ball Online can also assume the transformation by wishing to have their dormant Saiyan powers unlocked.

                The Super Saiyan form first premiered in April 1991, within chapter 317 of the Dragon Ball manga, entitled "Life or Death". It also made its anime debut in 1991, first appearing in Dragon Ball Z episode 95, "Transformed at Last". Within Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, three further powered up transformations: the second[16][17] and third[18][19] forms succeed Super Saiyan, while the premier form also has two additional graded states[20] that focus on power, and also the final form[21][22] which is superior to the graded forms. The original Super Saiyan form can also be mastered[23] to improve some of its traits and remove some flaws.</p>

            <p>Super Saiyan 2 </br>(超スーパーサイヤ人じん２ツー Sūpā Saiya-jin Tsū), initially referred to as Super Saiyan Fifth Grade at the time of its debut,[1] though referred to as "Ascended Super Saiyan" in the Funimation dub only, is the direct successor to the first Super Saiyan transformation. It is very similar to the original form in appearance and attainment; however, the power output is far greater, as speed, strength, and energy output all drastically increase.

                Gohan is the first person to attain the form in the manga and the anime, and he uses it while fighting against Cell in the Cell Games. Goku, Vegeta and Future Trunks soon follow. Goku trains to achieve it in the Other World, while both Vegeta and Future Trunks reach the form by training on Earth.
                
                In the anime, Caulifla attains this form right after becoming a Super Saiyan, making her the first female Super Saiyan 2 in the main series.</p>

            <p>Super Saiyan 3 </br>(超スーパーサイヤ人じん３スリー Sūpā Saiya-jin Surī) is the third form of Super Saiyan and the successor to the second transformation. This form extracts every drop of potential from a Saiyan's blood. Goku was the first to achieve the form and was able to do so after several years of vigorous training in Other World. Gotenks later achieves this form through the power of Trunks and Goten's fusion, Gotenks and with Goku's example.

                Super Saiyan God </br>(超スーパーサイヤ人じんゴッド Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo) is a Saiyan transformation that grants the user godly ki, providing them with a power boost beyond Super Saiyan 3 and its predecessors. It is initially obtained through a ritual involving six righteous Saiyans or special divine training.

Trained users can further combine this form with the first Super Saiyan transformation, attaining the more powerful Super Saiyan Blue or Super Saiyan Rosé form (depending on the user's status and ki).

            <p>Super Saiyan Blue </br>(超サイヤ人ブルー, Sūpā Saiya-jin Burū), originally known as Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (超スーパーサイヤ人じんゴッド超スーパーサイヤ人じん, Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo Sūpā Saiya-jin)[1] before Whis suggested its current designation, is a heightened transformation unique to the members of the Saiyan race and a natural (albeit hybridized) evolution of both Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan. Son Gokū describes it literally as the Super Saiyan form of Super Saiyan God.[5]

                As the name suggests, it is a transformation that combines the Super Saiyan transformation and the mastery of god ki used to become a Super Saiyan God. It is the ultimate transformation of the Saiyan race, though both Vegeta and Gokū were able to evolve and drastically improve it respectively. Gokū also later achieved a power (not related to the Saiyan transformations) beyond it.[1][6] Like Super Saiyan, it is also able to be completed.
                
                It is also the counterpart of the Super Saiyan Rosé transformation. Whereas Blue is the form adopted by a mortal Saiyan who obtains god ki, Rosé is the form taken by a Saiyan who is purely divine.</p>

           <p>Ultra Instinct</br>[3][4][5] is an ultimate technique that separates the consciousness from the body, allowing it to move and fight independent of a martial artist's thoughts and emotions.[6] It is an extraordinarily difficult technique to master, even for the Hakaishin. However, angels like Whis appear to have mastered it. As a result, it is known as the "state of the gods" (神の領域, kami no ryōiki).

            This technique uniquely manifests as a transformation in Son Gokū and is his most powerful form, transcending Super Saiyan Blue. Despite this, Beerus and the other gods recognize the transformation's completed form, hinting that it might not be completely unique to Gokū.[7]</p>

           <p>Ultra Ego </br>(我儘わがままの極意ごくい Wagamama no Goku'i, lit. "The Secret of the Self-indulgent") is a transformation which utilizes the Ultra Ego technique as well as the power of destruction.[3][4] It is used by Vegeta.</p>
